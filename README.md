## The challenge

my  challenge was to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Expected behaviour

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state
